# Ma, et al. Analysis Notes

[Pan-cancer genome and transcriptome analyses of 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid
tumours](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25795) (Ma et al., _Nature_, 2018) examines commonalities
and differences of genomic variants and RNA expression across multiple pediatric cancer types.

[Table S2](../../data/41586_2018_BFnature25795_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx) contains the SMG list from this
study. A significance call was added to this table to select only SMGs with pan-cancer significance 
of Q < 0.05, as determined by at least one algorithm. Filtering the table using this, we ended with 
[138 SMGs](../../data/ma_smgs.txt).
