# Rusch et al. Analysis Notes

This paper focused on methods for integrating WES, WGS, and RNA-seq data,
with an emphasis on linking SV / CNV data between these methods.

No statistical evaluation / classification of mutation frequency in this
cohort was reported, so no SMGs or hotspots are available for inclusion
in this survey.
