accepted,7194,MYB,AMPLIFICATION,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,MYB amplification was detected in 28 of 263 patients with PLGGs using Fluorescence In situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The amplification of MYB was strongly associated with greater progression-free survival (p=0.04) but did not affect overall survival (p=0.13) [amplified (n=19) vs not amplified (n=177)]. MYB amplification was not an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.,B,Prognostic,Supports,Better Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,
accepted,7190,ATRX,DELETION,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,Loss of ATRX was identified in 12 of 247 patients with PLGGs using immunohistochemistry. Survival analysis showed that ATRX loss was associated with adverse overall survival (p<0.0001) and progression-free survival (p<0.002) [mt (n=10) vs wt (n=175)].,B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,
accepted,7192,CDKN2A,DELETION,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,CDKN2A deletion was identified in 24 of 273 patients with PLGGs using FISH analysis. An association between this alteration and BRAFV600E was detected (p=0.0001). Hemispheric tumors with CDKN2A deletion were associated with shorter progression-free survival (p=0.0073) but did not affect overall survival (p=0.5) [mt (n=10) vs wt (n=59)]. CDKN2A deletion remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis for PFS [HR 4.38 (95% CI 1.05–18.23); p = 0.043]. CDKN2A deletion was not a prognostic factor in midline or cerebellar tumors.,B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,
accepted,7532,IKZF1,DELETION,Pediatric B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,N/A,"A meta-analysis of 8 published studies including 1008 adult patients (all patients were >14 years old) with B-ALL showed that IKZF 1 deletion had a negative impact on overall survival (HR=1.4, 95% CI 1.13–1.73) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR=1.67, 95% CI 1.28–2.17). In addition, IKZF1 deletion could independently predict unfavorable OS (HR=1.6) and EFS (HR= 1.67) in BCR-ABL1-negative but not BCR-ABL1 positive patients.",B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,27815723,
accepted,7541,IKZF1,DELETION,Pediatric B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,N/A,"This study reports on a cohort of NCI high-risk, Ph-negative pediatric patients with B-ALL. Twenty eight out of 94 patients (~30%) were found to harbor IKZF1 deletions, which were associated with male sex (P=0.45), Hispanic ethnicity (P=0.011) and an inferior outcome. IKZF1 deletion was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) in univariate (HR: 3.21, P=0.002) and multivariate analysis (HR: 2.64, P=0.016). IKZF1 deletion was associated with inferior disease-free survival (DFS) in univariate analysis (HR: 3.27, P=0.008) and showed a trend toward inferior DFS in multivariate analysis (HR: 2.7, P=0.087). The IKZF1 deletion was an independent predictor of adverse outcome, irrespective of the presence of a kinase-activating fusion.",B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,3,,PubMed,29507076,
accepted,7383,IKZF1,IKZF1 deletion and mutation,Pediatric B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,N/A,"This study reports on two pediatric cohorts with B-ALL. In the first cohort of 221 high risk, BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients, 55.2% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 73.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 74.6% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event (hematologic relapse, any relapse, a second malignant condition or death) as compared to 14%, 25.2%, and 27.1%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL.",B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,19129520,
accepted,7203,FGFR1,INTERNAL DUPLICATION,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,"This GWAS study identified a structural variant of FGFR1. Duplication of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FGFR1 was found in 11 of 149 patients (13/151 tumor samples, including 2 recurrent tumors) with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) and related low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). This alteration resulted in autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and subsequent activation of downstream PI3K and MAPK/ERK pathways. Also, transfection of Tp53-null astrocytes with TDK duplicated FGFR1 and implantation into the brains of nude mice results in high-grade astrocytic tumours with short latency and complete penetrance. Of note, this variant was present in 24% (8 of 34) of grade II diffuse cerebral gliomas.",B,Diagnostic,Supports,Positive,Somatic,4,,PubMed,23583981,
accepted,7193,BRAF,KIAA1549-BRAF,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified in 87 of 272 patients with PLGGs using Fluorescence In situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. This mutation was strongly associated with a greater progression-free survival (p=0.0017) and overall survival (p=0.0029) [fusion-positive (n=64) vs fusion-negative (n=141)].,B,Prognostic,Supports,Better Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,
accepted,7200,BRAF,KIAA1549-BRAF,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,"Hawkins et al. (2011) retrospectively studied 70 consecutive patient with incompletely resected pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGA). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified in 60% of cases in this cohort. Multi-variant analysis suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was the most significant favorable prognosis factor in incompletely resected PLGA and was independent of location, pathology, and age. Five-year PFS of fusion positive and fusion negative patients were 61% +/- 8% and 18% +/- 8% (P=0.0004), respectively. These results suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion confers a less aggressive clinical phenotype on PLGA and may explain their tendency to growth arrest.",B,Prognostic,Supports,Better Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,21610142,
accepted,7189,H3-3A,MUTATION,Pediatric Low-grade Glioma (PLGG),N/A,"Using Sanger sequencing, H3F3A mutations in patients with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) were identified (K27M: 13/280; G34R: 5/280). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that H3F3A mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [15 cases with H3F3A mutation (n=15) vs wt (n=197); p<0.0001 for both OS and PFS]. A further multivariate analysis indicated H3F3A mutation as an independent, unfavorable prognosis marker for both PFS [HR 2.76 (95% CI 1.10–6.94); p = 0.031] and OS [HR 3.96 (95% CI 1.36–11.53); p = 0.012].",B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,

This mutation was enriched in hemispheric tumors (p<0.007) and was associated with shorter progression-free survival (p=0.011) and overall survival (p=0.032) [mt (n=18) vs wt (n=166)].",B,Prognostic,Supports,Poor Outcome,Somatic,4,,PubMed,29948154,
